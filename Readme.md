## Hitori

I was spending Christmas alone (like always, and I don't really celebrate Christmas), so I decided to play [Hitori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitori). Now I don't consider myself an expert, but I've played this game before and I think I do well. I went on [hitoriconquest.com](hitoriconquest.com) and played a few games; apparently, most of the time, I'm only better than around 50% (~1:15 to 1:30s) of the players. Unacceptable! Rarely, I get 75% but that's not good enough.

You only need a handful of basic patterns. After that, it's simple scanning.
Maybe I need to scan better? Or perhaps, learn more complex patterns?

I couldn't dismiss the possibility of there being many bots. So I wrote a solver
to see how fast I would be if I already knew the solution.

The solver returns instantaneously and it takes around 35-40s to fill in the colors. And still, 10% of the players were better. So, just around 50 bots.

How fast are human solvers anyway? I can't find any videos of championships on YouTube.

Welp, I guess I need to do better.
